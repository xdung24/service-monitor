| Favicon | ✅ Done | SVG favicon embedded from `internal/web/public/`; static files under `public/` served at root with correct content-type |
| Homepage (landing page) | ✅ Done | Unauthenticated landing page at `/` showing app tagline and feature highlights; authenticated visitors are redirected to `/monitors` |
| Public status pages index | ✅ Done | Unauthenticated `/pages` route listing all `is_public=true` status pages across all users |

| Session expiry (server-side) | ✅ Done | Signed token includes issued-at; middleware rejects tokens older than `SESSION_MAX_AGE` |
| CSRF protection | ✅ Done | Double-submit token (`sm_csrf` + `_csrf` / `X-CSRF-Token`) on state-changing requests |
| Rate limiter stale-entry eviction | ✅ Done | Background cleanup removes inactive IP entries every 5 min (15 min idle TTL) |
